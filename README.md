# Sales-Dashboard-Excel


## Project Objectives:
- Sales Analysis: Analyze total sales, cost, profit, and transaction count across various regions and sales reps.
- Data Segmentation: Use pivot tables and slicers to break down sales data by product, customer, region, and sales rep.
- Visual Insights: Provide clear visualizations of key metrics to help stakeholders quickly grasp performance trends.

## Important Functions and Features:
- Pivot Tables: Used to dynamically summarize sales data (total sales, cost, profit, and transaction count).
- Slicers: Enable filtering by Customer, Region, and Sales Representative for detailed insights.
- Pivot Charts: Visualize trends in sales, cost, and profit across different dimensions (e.g., region, customer).
- Formulas: Used for calculating profit margins, total transactions, and other KPIs.

## Steps I followed to create the dashboard: 
1. Create the pivot tables
2. Name them (right click on the PT, and go to pivot table options, and name it)
3. Create Pivot charts for each PT (Insert -> Pivot Chart)
4. Clean and format the Pivot Chart (remove the buttons, remove the legend, remove gridlines, assign name, format - design format, size it)
5. Take the charts into the Dashboard Summary Sheet
6. Align them
7. Create Slicers (Select a Pivot Table, Pivot Table Analyze, Insert Slicer)
8. Format the slicers and take them to Dashboard Summary sheet
9. Connect the slicers to the Pivot Tables (Right click, Report connections)
10. Select the monthly sales PT, Go to Pivot Table Analyze, Insert Timeline
11. Format the date timeline, and take it to the Dashboard Summary sheet.
